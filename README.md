#### Description:

This is Gamefi Calculator!

So, first i used some gifs of Axie Infinity, the most famous game, cause its have more assets on google images, and i thought that using gifs, the website would be more dynamic and less "frozen".

Second i get the logo of the 2 games, and link they to the respective page of each one

On axie.html i used 3 types of teams, cause in the game we have many options of compositions, so basically i resumed in 3 types of teams: weak, good and strong

for ccar.html the rewards the game is based on how many cars you have, and the types of the cars. So after the user select this, we calculate the average of earnings based on the selected cars.

To result.html, i used the api of the cryptocompare.com website to get the SLP and CCAR price (its the token earned in the games) and using the app.js i pass the type of team or cars choosed by user, and send to result.html using localStorage.
When app2.js gets the type of team / cars, it uses the api to get the current price of SLP/CCar, and calculate how much the user would earn based on composition he choosed, using day, week and month estimative. 

I thought in use 1 html file for every result, by using one i don't need to create so many html file, reducing the memory needed, so in result.html we use the API to get the actual price of tokens, and actual price of earnings of the games.
